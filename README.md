## Description       
Romance has gone amiss in the world. We find too many failed relationships and broken homes, devastating those inside. It only adds resentment, pain, and suffering to the world. We have a solution. Most relationships simply look  at the stars, we want them to be a part of the stars, built directly off of strong foundations in astrology and mystic science. We can ensure your future relationship will be a success based off of our proprietary matching algorithm, pulling planetary data from various APIs and combining them with their known traits to ensure the perfect match. Don’t just look at the stars, become a part of them, with Star-Crossed.
